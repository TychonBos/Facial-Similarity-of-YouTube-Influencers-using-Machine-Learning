# Facial-Similarity-of-YouTube-Influencers-using-Machine-Learning

Datasets

The YouTube Faces Database is used for training the Siamese Neural Networks and can be downloaded from https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~wolf/ytfaces/

The influencer data, which is manually collected, includes images of 15 (10 males and 5 females) YouTube influencers. This dataset is only used for evaluating the models. The influencer data can be found in this repository.

Packages and versions

The programming part of this research is implemented with Python 3.8.5. A separate environment was created within Anaconda Navigator, where Juypyter Notebook was mainly used for developing Python code. The code depends on the following packages with their versions: PyTorch (1.10.2) with CUDA toolkit (11.3.1), Matplotlib (3.5.1), Numpy (1.21.5), OpenCV (4.0.1), deepface (https://github.com/serengil/deepface) and scikit learn (0.23.2).
