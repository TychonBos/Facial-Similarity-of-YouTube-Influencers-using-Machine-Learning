The programming part of this research is implemented with Python 3.8.5. A separate environment was created within Anaconda Navigator, where Juypyter Notebook was mainly used for developing Python code. The code depends on the following packages with their versions: PyTorch (1.10.2) with CUDA toolkit (11.3.1), Matplotlib (3.5.1), Numpy (1.21.5), OpenCV (4.0.1), deepface \citep{serengil2020lightface, serengil2021lightface} and scikit learn (0.23.2).
